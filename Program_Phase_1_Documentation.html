Bison Maps Project Phase 1

The main program (BisonMaps.java) reads in a map from a file, and continually reads in two integers from the user and print out the shortest path from the first number (s) to the second number (d).

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (Dijkstra.java) goes through each point (starting with one of the two inputed numbers) and finds the adjacent point with the shortest distance then switches to that point and repeats the same process until connects the two inputed numbers.

EuclideanGraph.java creates a graph on points in the plane, the weights of the edges being the Euclidean distances.

In.java reads in the data.

IndexPQ.java keeps track a copy of the priorities in a queue.

InIterator.java iterates to the next element.

Point.java create points in the plane and determines the Euclidean distance between the point and the main point that is looking for shortest distance.

StdIn.java helps read in the data.
